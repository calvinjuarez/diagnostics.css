diagnostics.css
===============

A set of flexible styles to help you debug and diagnose your CSS. Includes classes provide visual feedback so you can quickly see how your styles are being applied.

Inspired by [a tip](http://csswizardry.com/web-design+/#css-2) in Harry Robert's publication, [Web Design+](http://csswizardry.com/web-design+/). This is my take on a diagnostic stylesheet.
